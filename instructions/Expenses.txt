Instructions:
First determine the location of the expense. By default, it is BDMS unless there is mention of it belonging to a different company. 
Then determine the expense account to be used. Prioritize the use of sub-accounts rather than parent accounts. Do use parent accounts if there was no sub-account or the sub-account was unidentifiable. If no account was identified use an account that is for unrecognized, undetermined, or otherwise unknown expenses.

The default paid through account is expense provisions.
