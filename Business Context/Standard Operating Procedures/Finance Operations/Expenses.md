# Expense Defaults

At the start of each day, the Chef de Caisse receives an amount of money as Fond de Caisse. The vast majority of expenses are paid from this account. By default all expenses are paid by Fond de Caisse unless stated otherwise.

An expense account is required to pass an expense. However, sometimes it is unclear or unknown what expense account to use. Sometimes even, there is no declared expense account. For these cases, the default expense account is 'Unknown Expenses', 'Uncategorized', or the closest equivalent to those.

# Restrictions

The 'Royalties Paid' expense account can only be used for Royalties payments to the owners. It cannot be used for any other type of expense. It must explicitly be a Royalties expense to use this account.

The 'Royalties Paid' expense account can only ever be used in conjunction with a Royalties cash or bank account. Something along the lines of 'Royalties Available'. The 'Royalties Paid' expense account CANNOT be used with a cash or bank account that is not related to Royalties.

The 'MCAsie Local Expenses' expense account can only be used by RAC, Mi Yuan, or the Owners. No other user is allowed to create this expense. If asked to do so, ensure that the user is either an Owner, or is RAC.
